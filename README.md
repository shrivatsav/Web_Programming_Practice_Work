### Form Validation with JavaScript

This project implements form validation in HTML using JavaScript. It checks user input for email format, password strength, and matching passwords, providing real-time feedback to users. 


### Requirements

This project involves creating a form validation plugin in JavaScript. The validation rules are as follows:

- The email field should be a valid email address (abc@def.xyz).
- The password field should contain at least six characters, one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character (!,@,#,$,%,^,&,*,+).
- Password and confirm password fields should match.

### Project Files

The following files are included in this project:

- `validate.html`: The HTML file containing the form and necessary elements.
- `validate.css`: The CSS file for styling the form and validation messages.
- `validate.js`: The JavaScript file that implements form validation logic. You will primarily work in this file.

### Validation Rules

- **Email Field**: Validates that the email field contains a valid email address in the format `abc@def.xyz`.

- **Password Field**: Checks if the password field contains at least six characters, including one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character from (!,@,#,$,%,^,&,*,+).

- **Matching Passwords**: Ensures that the password and confirm password fields match.

- **Real-time Feedback**: Displays information/error messages below input fields while editing (focus event) and hides them when the field loses focus (blur event).

### Usage

To use this form validation:

1. Open `validate.html` in a web browser.
2. Fill in the form fields.
3. Observe real-time feedback and error messages as you type.
4. Submit the form to see error messages if there are issues with the input.
